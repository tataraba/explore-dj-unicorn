## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

As part of the Djangonaut Space program, I'm getting more acquainted with the django-unicorn library. This is my first attempt at getting familiar with this stack.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed on your system.

You can install Python from [Python.org](https://www.python.org)

### Installing

1. Clone the project to your local machine. If you are unsure how to do that, refer to documentation on Github.
2. Make sure that `pdm` is installed: https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/#installation.
3. `pdm install`


## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Once tests are configured, you'll be able to run them 😅


## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

You should be able to run the project like any other Django project, using the appropriate Django command.

```
pdm run python manage.py runserver
```
